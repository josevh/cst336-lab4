        <p>Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place 
            we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things.</p>
        <p>While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it 
            is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the 
            surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the 
            biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are 
            made of rock and metal.</p>
        <p>The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, 
            except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and 
            goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply 
            means “the ground.”</p>
